## 👋 Hey, I’m Paul

I’m a **software engineer** who enjoys building things end-to-end — from clean user interfaces to solid, well-designed back-end systems.

Most of my experience is in **JavaScript**, both **front-end and back-end**, and lately I’ve been diving into **Rust** to better understand systems programming, performance, and memory safety.
